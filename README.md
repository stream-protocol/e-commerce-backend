### In the context of the Solana blockchain and Web3 payment platform, here are key points to consider:

1. **Decentralization:** Web3 applications and payment gateways leverage the decentralized nature of blockchain technology. Transactions are verified by a distributed network of nodes, reducing the reliance on a central authority.

2. **Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts (programs) are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They enable automated and trustless execution of transactions, enhancing security and transparency.

3. **Cryptocurrencies:** Web3 payment gateways often facilitate payments using cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL) on the Solana blockchain, EUROC and USDC stablecoins, Stream Token (STRM), and other tokens specific to a particular blockchain network.

4. **Security:** Solana Blockchain's inherent security features, such as cryptographic hashing and consensus mechanisms, enhance the security of transactions and data storage.

5. **Digital Ownership:** Web3 payment gateways can enable the transfer of digital assets, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which represent ownership of unique digital items.

6. **Interoperability:** Some Web3 payment gateways aim to provide interoperability between different blockchain networks and payment methods, making it easier for users to transact across various platforms.

7. **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** Stream (Web3) Payment Gateways can be integrated with DeFi protocols, allowing for decentralized lending, borrowing, and other financial services.

8. **Web3 Wallets:** Users require a Web3 wallet (such as a browser extension, Stream**Pay** wallet, or other mobile apps) to interact with Web3 payment gateways and sign transactions securely.

9. **StreamPOS: Point Of Sale System:** Medusa backend + Stream**POS** Widget
   
10. **Merchant Portal (Medusa Admin UI):** 

**Stream**Payments™ Merchant Portal is a platform that offers a Web3-based payment gateway API for businesses to integrate online payment processing with Solana blockchain technology. Web3 typically refers to the next evolution of the internet, where decentralized technologies like blockchain are used to build applications that are more secure, private, and user-centric.
